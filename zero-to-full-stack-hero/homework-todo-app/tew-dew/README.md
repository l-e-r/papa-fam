# Homework : Let's Build a TODO App with React

## The CRUD Homework Assignment!

Your client requires a TODO list application, they have submitted a list of requirements. The application must have the following features:

- The ability to type into an input field and hit the ENTER key to add a TODO to a list of TODO's
- The ability to delete a todo from the todo list
- The ability to update a todo from the todo list
- Each TODO must automatically be capitalised when added to the list of TODO's
- There should be a button on each TODO to indicate completion of a TODO, the text should turn green and have a strikethrough once completed
- The TODO app should be styled appropriately (you could use Glassmorphism!)
- At the top of the page, the client wants an inspirational quote which is different each time the user refreshes the page. The quote should be fetched from the following API: https://type.fit/api/quotes

* CHALLENGE: Persist the TODO's so that when the user refreshes the page, the list of TODO's is preserved!
* CHALLENGE 2: Add animations to the TODO list using this library!
